1. Purpose

To detect errors/inconsistencies in read/write schedule declarations.

To use this thorn simply add it to your ActiveThorns list.

ReadWriteDiagnostic uses checksums to identify which grid functions, and which
regions of grid functions, have been written to within the body of a scheduled
item. 

If no read/write tags are present in the schedule for a schedule item, this
thorn will check all grid functions that contain CCTK_REAL. If read/write tags
are present, only those variables/groups which are identified will be checked.

Inconsistencies between the schedule, and writes that take place during a
run of the code will be printed out in CCTK_TERMINATE.

To prevent scheduled routines from making use of variables that aren't in the
read/write list, include the header "rdwr_declare.h" at the top of the source file
containing the routine. This header will redefine CCTKi_VarDataPtrI to
RDWR_VarDataPtrI. The function RDWR_VarDataPtrI() will return a null pointer
for variables outside your scheduled item's read/write lists.  This should
trigger a segfault if you make use of one of these grid functions.
